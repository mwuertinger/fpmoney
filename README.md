[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/nikolaydubina/fpmoney.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nikolaydubina/fpmoney)

* `ISO 4217`
* as fast as `int64`
* no `float` in parsing nor printing
* zero overhead arithmetics
* block mismatched currency arithmetics
* does not leak precision
* Fuzz tests
* parsing is faster than `int`, `float`, `string`
* 200 LOC
* `int64` can fit enough of `BTC` _satoshi_ and even few `ETH` _wei_

```go
var BuySP500Price = fpmoney.FromInt(9000, iso4217.SGD)

input := []byte(`{"sp500": {"amount": 9000.02, "currency": "SGD"}}`)

type Stonks struct {
    SP500 fpmoney.Amount `json:"sp500"`
}
var v Stonks
if err := json.Unmarshal(input, &v); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

amountToBuy := fpmoney.FromInt(0, iso4217.SGD)
if v.SP500.GreaterThan(BuySP500Price) {
    amountToBuy = amountToBuy.Add(v.SP500.Mul(2))
}

fmt.Println(amountToBuy)
// Output: 18000.04 SGD
```

### Division

Division always returns remainder.
Fractional cents can never be reached.

```go
x := fpmoney.FromInt(1, iso4217.SGD)
a, r := x.Div(3)
fmt.Println(a, r)
// Output: 0.33 SGD 0.01 SGD

a, r = x.Div(5)
fmt.Println(a, r)
// Output: 0.20 SGD 0 SGD
```

### Cross Currency Protection

Akin to integer division by 0, which panics in Go, arithmetic operations on differnet currenices result in panic.
Returning error in arithmetic operation would prohibit chaning of method calls, which is not convenient.
It is better to stop execution, rather then corrupt value.
Mismatched or missing currencies must be caught at testing or QA of your code.

Two mechanisms to reduce panics are planned for future versions:
1. package level var for enable/disable currency check
2. package level var for fallback currency

### Ultra Small Fractions

Some denominatinos have very low fractions. 
Storing them `int64` you would get. 

- `BTC` _satoshi_ is `1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi`, which is still enough for ~`92,233,720,368 BTC`.
- `ETH` _wei_ is `1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 wei`, which is ~`9 ETH`. If you deal with _wei_, you may consider `bigint` or multiple `int64`. In fact, official Ethereum code is in Go and it is using bigint ([code](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/params/denomination.go)).

Given that currency enumn still takes at least 1B in separate storage from `int64` in struct and Go allocates 16B of memory for struct regardless, current implementation reserved padding bytes.
It is sensible to use extra space our ot 16B to support long integer arithmetics.
Implementing this is area of furthter research.

## Appendix A: json.Unmarshal optimizations

Parsing is surprisingly slow. It is ~6x of `float32` + `string`.

Use `json.NewDecoder` and parse directly.
```
BenchmarkJSONUnmarshal/small-10           2030568          2977 ns/op        1599 B/op          38 allocs/op

```

Make container struct and wrap int and iso4217 currency and copy values.
```
BenchmarkJSONUnmarshal/small-10           2776969          2160 ns/op         430 B/op           8 allocs/op
BenchmarkJSONUnmarshal/large-10           2649692          2263 ns/op         448 B/op           8 allocs/op
```

Two passes over string, find `amount` and find `currency`.
```
BenchmarkJSONUnmarshal/small-10            686832          1732 ns/op         198 B/op           3 allocs/op

```

Parsing just amount takes 400ns.

Package `github.com/ferdypruis/iso4217@v1.2.0` does cast of string to currency through loop.
But we have predefined currencies, we can rely on compiler for that.
Optimizing this cast by avoiding mallocs and loops.

As of `2022-06-17`, package `github.com/ferdypruis/iso4217@v1.2.1` uses map to cast currency.
It is as efficient as switch case.
Thanks @ferdypruis for the update!
